# Regrade Guidelines

Exams will be scanned, then graded on Gradescope. After scores are released, you can dispute your score on specific questions. These regrade requests will notify the grader to review the score assignment for your submission.

The course staff work hard to grade quickly and fairly; however, we still make mistakes! _It is your responsibility_ to go through your exam to get feedback on what you did right/wrong, **and** to check to see if there were any mistakes in grading. We put effort into your grade - please put effort into understanding it.

The main idea is to: look at your exam, grader feedback, and sample solution and make sure you understand why you got something wrong and to see if there were any grading mistakes.

## Do's and Don'ts of Regrade Requests

### Do

1. **Do view your exam and look at the feedback** that you received from either the rubric items themselves or comments left by the grader. If you do not understand where you went wrong, please go to office hours or create a private Campuswire post, and we can discuss it there.
2. **Do compare your answer to the sample solution** posted in Moodle (under Exams and Solutions after scores are released). Try to see what you did wrong and where you could improve. If this solution involves code, type it up and run it. Test your solution to see where you went wrong.
3. **Do look at the rubric.** We grade according to a rubric that is applied to all submissions. Be specific in saying that this specific rubric item should be removed/added based on your work.

### Don't

1. **Don't ask for extra points.** We will not give you extra points. We grade off a rubric and you have that rubric in front of you, look at the specific rubric items that you think you deserve to get more points from and the grader will look into your request.
2. **Don't write an essay.** It is great to have some detail about your thought process and what you want to be fixed; however, try to be concise so it will be faster for us to get anything fixed.

## Examples of Good and Bad Regrade Requests

### Good

> I see I was marked as having X but Iâ€™m not sure where I made that mistake because of Y.

This will let the grader know to focus more closely on that rubric item and check to see if it was a mistake and should be removed. If it wasn't a mistake in grading, they will be able to give you an explanation of where it is in your solution and you can learn from that.

> I think I was graded too harshly on this. According to the sample solution, I have roughly half of the solution and I think it deserves to have rubric item X applied instead.

This will let the grader know exactly what rubric item you want to be applied and will let us reexamine your solution.

> The rubric item X was not applied here even though I did X.

This is a concise way to just let the grader know of the mistake. We do try to grade quickly so sometimes a rubric item might not get applied.

### Bad

> I think I should get more points here.

This is vague and will only result in us saying "No". Be more specific and give us a rubric item that you think should be given/taken off.

> [[some multi-paragraph essay about the logic of the solution with no ask]]

Please keep your regrade requests concise and specific. It does help to have an idea of what your thought process and logic were - but keep that to a few sentences and have a clear request of what rubric item you want to be changed.

## Summary

Please keep these do's and don'ts and examples in mind when sending in regrade requests. Regardless of how you did on the exam, you should always go over the grading to see if there were any mistakes and send in specific and concise regrade requests. Sometimes you will get points back, other times you will get an explanation that can help you get a better understanding of what you did wrong.

Regrade requests are available for about one week after the grades have been released. Plan accordingly and review your exam and make your regrade requests before that deadline.
