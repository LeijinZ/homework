# Lab Work

1. Install the prerequisite software. See the ["Setting Up Your Development Environment"](./homework/ENVIRONMENT.md)
2. Download the [empty practice assignment](../practice-assignments/01-empty-assignment/01-empty-assignment.zip)
3. Unzip and open the folder in VSCode. See [editing document](./homework/EDITING.md) if you are unsure how to do so.
4. Open a VSCode terminal (`Terminal -> New Terminal`)
5. `npm install`
6. Make edits to `main.ts`
7. `npm run start`

If you would like to make named files, such as `lab-01.ts`, then make them inside the `src/` directory. To run them, type in the terminal `npx ts-node ./src/lab-01.ts`.
